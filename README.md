# Supervised-Multi-Class-Text-Classification-Natural-Language-Processing

AIM:

- Supervised learning model for automatic classification of employee expenses under the
pre-defined company metrics or expense categories.
- Unsupervised learning model for classification of merchant IDâ€™s.
- Basically if an employee does a transaction, the model should automatically
classify the transaction in a predefined expense category set by the company.
- Also if the same merchant is used extensively by the employees, then have a tie-
up.


PROCESS:

- Trained the text corpus based on various NLP algorithms such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec and
Doc2Vec approaches and compared the results.
- Obtained best accuracy of results with TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document
frequency) approach.
